# The Thrust Compiler

These are the available cargo alias in the whole project, to perform either compiler fuzzing or generation of Rust's code documentation.

## Stable Compiler Fuzzing

### LLVM (Top-Level)

It fuzz the LLVM backend with supposed stable features (top-level codegen).
```console
cargo fuzz-llvm-top-level-stable
```

### LLVM (Local)

It fuzz the LLVM backend with supposed stable features (local codegen).
```console
cargo fuzz-llvm-local-stable
```

### LLVM (Local, Loops)

It fuzz the LLVM backend with supposed stable features (local codegen, focused on loops).
```console
cargo fuzz-llvm-local-loops-stable
```

### Pipeline

It fuzz the AST validation pipeline, including semantic analysis with supposed stable features.
```console
cargo fuzz-pipeline-stable
```

## Unstable Compiler Fuzzing

### LLVM (Top-Level)

It fuzz the LLVM backend with supposed unstable features (top-level codegen).
```console
cargo fuzz-llvm-top-level-unstable
```

### LLVM (Local)

It fuzz the LLVM backend with supposed unstable features (local codegen).
```console
cargo fuzz-llvm-local-unstable
```

### LLVM (Local, Loops)

It fuzz the LLVM backend with supposed unstable features (local codegen, focused on loops).
```console
cargo fuzz-llvm-local-loops-unstable
```

### Pipeline

It fuzz the AST validation pipeline, including semantic analysis with supposed unstable features.
```console
cargo fuzz-pipeline-unstable
```

## Lexer Fuzzing

It fuzz the lexer with a universal corpus and stable dictionary.
```console
cargo fuzz-lexer
```

## Auxiliary Binaries

These helpers inspect a fuzzer crash artifact (raw bytes input) without running the fuzzer.

### AST dump (Top-Level)

Reconstructs and prints the AST using the `Arbitrary` trait. Matches the `pipeline` fuzzer.
```console
cargo fuzz-dump-ast-top-level <crash-file>
```

### AST dump (Local)

Reconstructs and prints the AST using the scoped AST generator. Matches the `llvm-codegen-local` fuzzer.
```console
cargo fuzz-dump-ast-local <crash-file>
```

### AST dump (Local, Loops)

Same as `fuzz-dump-ast-local` but for the loop oriented AST generator. Matches the `llvm-codegen-local-loops` fuzzer.
```console
cargo fuzz-dump-ast-local-loops <crash-file>
```

### LLVM IR dump

Reconstructs the AST with a scoped generator, runs semantic analysis + LLVM codegen and dumps the module IR to `fuzz/llvm_ir_dumps/`. It does **not** run `module.verify()`, so the IR is dumped even when it is invalid. Optional `generator` (`llvm-codegen-local` by default, or `llvm-codegen-local-loops`) and `--stable` flag are supported.
```console
cargo fuzz-dump-llvm-ir <crash-file> [generator] [--stable]
```

### Crash reproduction

Automates crash reproduction. Rebuilds and runs the target fuzzer against the crash artifact and classifies the result against known crash signatures. Run without arguments to get an interactive selection menu.
```console
cargo fuzz-reproduce-case [<target> <artifact>]
```

## Continuous Compiler Fuzzing

Unlike the one-shot aliases above (which stop at the first crash), the continuous supervisor runs a fuzzer in a loop, archives every crash/panic it finds (input + AST dump + LLVM IR dump) into `fuzz/backlog/`, records them in the cascading registry `fuzz/fuzz_continuous/<target>.log`, and immediately resumes fuzzing. The default mode is `stable`; pass `--mode unstable` to fuzz unstable features.

### Supervisor commands

```console
cargo fuzz-continuous run <target> [--mode stable|unstable] [--runs N] [--max-time S]
```

Runs the target in a loop (one-shot with `--runs`/`--max-time`). Targets: `lexer`, `pipeline`, `llvm-codegen-top-level`, `llvm-codegen-local`, `llvm-codegen-local-loops`.

```console
cargo fuzz-continuous run-all [--mode stable|unstable]
```

Same, one fuzzer thread per target.

### Backlog management

```console
cargo fuzz-backlog list [--all]
cargo fuzz-backlog history [<target>]
cargo fuzz-backlog import <target>
cargo fuzz-backlog ignore <target> <issue-id>
cargo fuzz-backlog reopen <target> <issue-id>
cargo fuzz-backlog fixed <target> <issue-id>
```

- `list` shows the pending (`open`) errors per target (`--all` also shows `ignored`/`fixed`).
- `history` prints the cascading registry log(s).
- `import` archives crash artifacts already present under `fuzz/artifacts/<target>/`.
- `ignore` / `reopen` / `fixed` change an issue's status (ignored inputs are never re-archived).

### Shorthand aliases

```console
cargo fuzz-continuous-llvm-top-level-stable
cargo fuzz-continuous-llvm-top-level-unstable
cargo fuzz-continuous-llvm-local-stable
cargo fuzz-continuous-llvm-local-unstable
cargo fuzz-continuous-llvm-local-loops-stable
cargo fuzz-continuous-llvm-local-loops-unstable
cargo fuzz-continuous-pipeline-stable
cargo fuzz-continuous-pipeline-unstable
cargo fuzz-continuous-lexer
```

The first two are equivalent to `cargo fuzz-continuous run <target> --mode stable|unstable`; `fuzz-continuous-lexer` runs the lexer with the universal corpus (no mode).

> [!NOTE]
> The supervisor and `fuzz-reproduce-case` pick up the **nightly** channel declared in `fuzz/rust-toolchain.toml` automatically (they run `cargo +nightly fuzz run ...`), so you can invoke them from the repository root even though it pins a stable toolchain.
